This is an extremely basic and simple KitBot made for anarchy servers in minecraft
As of right now this will only work on servers that are in OFFLINE MODE!
This is built on nodejs

You neeed mineflayer for this bot to work

You can get nodejs here : https://nodejs.org/en/download
the command to install mineflayer is : npm install mineflayer

For the bot to work you need to change a couple values in the bot.js file

You will need the following values : 
1. Username of the Bot
2. Server IP and Port (must be an OFFLINE MODE server)
3. the password for the bot to login
4. Coordinates to a minecraft chest where the kits are stored (make sure this is correct!)
   

The kitbot can only deliver 1 type of kit as of right now, I might add more functionality if required

It is recommended that :
1. you set the spawnpoint of the Bot account right next to the chest via a bed
2. you make sure that it is allowed on the server that you are planning to use it on


If you wish to modify the code and make a version/modified copy of it yourself, feel free to do so
